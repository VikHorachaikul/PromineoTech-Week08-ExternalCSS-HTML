    <p class="homepage">Here is a picture of what my rescued dog might have looked like when she was younger! Her name is Abbie and we gave her a second chance at life on May 2021.
    She is a 10 year old Mastiff Amstaff mix and she is the sweetest dog I have ever met. She loves to cuddle and sleep all day. She is also a very picky eater and only eats beef and chicken.
